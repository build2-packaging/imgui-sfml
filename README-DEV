# Development Notes

The header file `imgui-SFML_export.h` in the `libimgui-framework-sfml` package is actually not symlinked but was copied and edited to avoid the redefinition of the macro `IMGUI_API`. The macro is already defined by the imgui base package, but `imgui-sfml` also defines it, so we had to copy the header file and remove the respective lines.

If the upstream version is updated, this file has to be revised and adjusted, if needed by the new version.
